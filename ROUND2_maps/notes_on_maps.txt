[[UPDATE - 2020 june 25th - have done ROUND2 of nnet training (using extra training data) - comments from ROUND2 are in square brackets like this comment is]]

2020 june 4th
GE's visual assments of the nnet's performance on the maps FD sent (scale 20k and 25k)
THIS IS FOR THE FIRST WORKING VERSIONS OF THE NNET (1 nnet for 25k, 1 nnet for 20k)
comments are somewhat subjective, but if you view a few of the outputs, you'll be 'calibrated' to GE's arbitary scale
ratings are based on how useful the nnet might be to a human user in terms of tracing boundaries
NOTE - ROUND2 comments have now also been added, they are enclosed in [[]] - e.g. [[this is a comment on the ROUND2 nnet outputs (rather than round 1)]]

                         OK/MEDIOCRE     SCAN IS MEDIOCRE IN PARTS, and there the nnet also is mediocre  -  MAYBE TRACE AS EXTRA TRAINING DATA ??

                         OK-ISH          - some bits are missed by nnet are ones it ought to have got - i.e. not all excusable by poor scan - TRACE ?   #TODO

COMMENTS:
           * [[ROUND2 is always better overall - some parts of a given map might be worse, but more parts are better.  For good round1 results, round2 is a small improvement (because it was good already) - for poor ROUND1 results, ROUND2 is a big improvement.]]
           * [[25000 is markedly harder than 20000 - mainly because the map scans are worse]]
	   * [[map scans can be OK in 1 part of an image, and POOR in other parts]]
           * [[chaff in sea and on land has gone in ROUND2 :)]]
           - nnet draws chaff in the sea - from the 'equaidistant-from-shore' lines  -  GE could fix this if users care  [[fixed in ROUND2]]
	   - struggles in cities to some degree - imo this is mainly because so few boundaries are in cities that the nnet has not seen many examples in its training data  -  again, GE thinks this is not a big deal  -  what do users think?
	   - nnet draws some stuff in totally blank regions  -  again, GE doesn't think this is a problem  [[fixed in ROUND2]]
	   - besides the 2 cases above, nnet has very low false +ve rate (i.e. it raely says that there is a boundary there when in fact there is no boundary)  :)
	   - nnet struggles on the odd boundary that winds back on itself a lot - the meandering results in the nnet making 'oxbow lakes' - not a big problem, but something that the user must sort out  [[somewhat better in ROUND2, but still a problem in some places]]
